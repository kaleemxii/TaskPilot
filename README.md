TaskPilot
=========

Minimal scaffolding for task automation using GitHub Copilot + Playwright MCP browser tools â€” with zero custom code in the repo. The focus is on driving repetitive workflows through natural-language playbooks and the provided Copilot operational instructions.

Overview
--------
TaskPilot is intentionally bare. It supplies only:
- Top-level Copilot behavior contract (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`).
- A clean workspace for creating / iterating automation playbooks conversationally.
