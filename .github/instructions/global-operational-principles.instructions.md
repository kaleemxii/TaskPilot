## Shared Operational Principles
- Always work in discrete, verifiable steps; confirm key transitions (navigation success, element presence).
- Use consistent field labels when capturing data to enable later merging.
- Record Unknown instead of guessing; do not hallucinate.
- Summaries must only contain information directly observed in the browser during the current session unless explicitly provided by the user.
- Maintain a transient working table in text form before producing polished output.
- Defer formatting polish until data completeness >= 80% (heuristic: fewer than 2 Unknown fields per project).
- Provide a final checklist of actions performed.
