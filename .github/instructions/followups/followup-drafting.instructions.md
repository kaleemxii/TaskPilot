## Followup Drafting Playbook
1. For each action item with context, select channel:
   - Use Email if formal update, external recipients, or multiple decisions.
   - Use Teams chat if quick clarification or small ask (<3 sentences).
2. Draft structure:
   - Subject / Opening line: Clear purpose ("Follow-up: <Action Synopsis>").
   - Context: 1 sentence summarizing origin.
   - Ask: Specific request + desired outcome + due date (if any).
   - Close: Appreciation + offer for clarification.
3. Tone: professional, concise, actionable.
4. Insert placeholders for missing data (e.g., [NEED DUE DATE]).
5. Stage drafts (do not send) and list them with Action ID mapping.
