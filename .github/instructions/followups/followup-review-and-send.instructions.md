## Followup Review & Send Playbook
1. Present summary: Action ID → Channel → Recipient(s) → Subject/First line.
2. Offer bulk approval (All) or selective (list IDs).
3. For each approved draft:
   - Reopen draft compose window.
   - Verify fields (recipients, subject/body) unchanged.
   - Send (or if system requires, click Send button) after final silent 2s verification.
4. Confirm sent state (e.g., presence in Sent Items / message posted to Teams thread link).
5. Update action table with Status = Sent + timestamp.
6. Provide final report and any drafts still pending user edits.
