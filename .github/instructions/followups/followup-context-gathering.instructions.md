## Followup Context Gathering Playbook
1. For each approved action item:
   - Open related meeting transcript section (if linkable) and capture up to 2 clarifying sentences around the action.
   - If reference to a document/issue appears, open it and extract title + one salient data point (e.g., current status line).
   - Avoid deep dives; stop after key facts sufficient for an informed, concise message.
2. Append context snapshot to action row: Context = [Key Fact 1; Key Fact 2].
3. Mark any missing critical context requiring user input.
