You have 50 images and their corresponding captions in the folder images and captions mapped to each photo in the captions.json folder. Build an index so that I can search through these 50 images using textual description. Evaluate the index built using the all_captions field in captions.json. Report the accuracy to me. Once the accuracy is good enough, host this searching functionality on a beautiful web interface mimicking one drive. I should be able to scroll through all the photos and also be able to search for them using text (displaying only the top 1 result). Ask clarifying questions if necessary.
